# heritrix-clojure

A Clojure library for speaking to Heritrix. It is ghetto as fuck - for
instance the way we've solved the SSL cert shit :D.

## Usage

Include in leiningen: 

```
user=> (use 'heritrix-clojure.core :reload)
nil
user=> (create-job "https://localhost:8443/engine/" "create-test" "admin" "admin")

...

```

You get the picture.
